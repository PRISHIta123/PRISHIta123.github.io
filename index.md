I am a Masters student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" style="color: blue">Cornell University</a>. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://vit.ac.in" style="color: blue">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT, Vellore) India</a>. Over the past few years, I have developed a growing interest in Deep Learning, Vision, Robotics and Cognitive AI, that inspired me to contribute in these domains through research as well as open-source. I always look forward to connecting with people having similar interests and exciting project ideas! You can reach out to me at pr376[at]cornell[dot]edu.
