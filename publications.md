<p><b>Charon: a FrameNet Annotation Tool for Multimodal Corpora</b>
<br><a style="font-size: 14px; color:gray">Proceedings of the 16th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (LAW-XVI) @LREC 2022</a> 
<br><a href="https://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2022/workshops/LAWXVI/pdf/2022.lawxvi-1.11.pdf" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;text-align: right;">[Paper]</a> <a href="https://PRISHIta123.github.io/bib/4.bib" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;text-align: right;">[BibTeX]</a><details><summary style="color: #CC0000;font-size: 14px;text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</summary><p><a style="font-size: 14px;">Multimodality refers to the property of any communication phenomenon where two or more modes – defined as experientially recognized resources for meaning-making shaped by society and culture – are brought into play (Jewitt and Kress, 2003; Kress, 2010;Bateman et al., 2017). This paper approaches the expansion of FrameNet annotation into the multimodal domain, as proposed in Belcavello et al. (2020), by presenting Charon: a semi-automatic, human-in-the-loop tool for annotating static and dynamic images for semantic frames. Charon was developed to meet the following key requirements: (i) compatibility with existing FrameNet software; (ii) annotation of image with FrameNet categories; (iii) linkage of image and textual
annotations.</a></p></details></p>

<p><b>A New Combined Model with Reduced Label Dependency for Malware Classification</b>
<br><a style="font-size: 14px; color:gray">3rd International Conference on Integrated Intelligent Computing Communication & Security (ICIIC), Aug 2021</a> 
<br><a href="https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/iciic-21/125960833" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;text-align: right;">[Paper]</a> <a href="https://github.com/PRISHIta123/RAELN" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;text-align: right;">[Code]</a> <a href="https://PRISHIta123.github.io/bib/1.bib" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;text-align: right;">[BibTeX]</a><details><summary style="color: #CC0000;font-size: 14px;text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</summary><p><a style="font-size: 14px;">With the technological advancements in recent times, security threats caused by malware are increasing with no bounds. The first step performed by security analysts for the detection and mitigation of malware is its classification. This paper aims to classify network intrusion malware using new-age machine learning techniques with Reduced label dependency and identifies the most effective combination of feature selection and classification technique for this purpose. The proposed model, L2 Regularized Autoencoder Enabled Ladder Networks Classifier (RAELN-Classifier), is developed based on a combinatory analysis of various feature selection techniques like FSFC, variants of autoencoders and semi-supervised classification techniques such as ladder networks. The model is trained and tested over UNSW-NB15 and benchmark NSL-KDD datasets for accurate real time model performance evaluation using overall accuracy as well as per-class accuracy and was found to result in higher accuracy compared to similar baseline and state-of-the-art models.</a></p></details></p>

<p><b>Stochastic Game Frameworks for Efficient Energy Management in Microgrid Networks</b>
<br><a style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Innovative Smart Grids Technology (ISGT Europe), IEEE PES, Netherlands, Nov 2020</a>
<br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9248952" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;">[Paper]</a> <a href="https://github.com/raghudiddigi/SmartGrids-DynamicPricing" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;">[Code]</a> <a href="https://PRISHIta123.github.io/bib/2.bib" style="color: blue;font-size: 14px;">[BibTeX]</a> <details><summary style="color: #CC0000;font-size: 14px;text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</summary><p><a style="font-size: 14px;">We consider the problem of energy management in microgrid networks. A microgrid is capable of generating power from a renewable resource and is responsible for handling the demands of its dedicated customers. Owing to the variable nature of renewable generation and the demands of the customers, it becomes imperative that each microgrid optimally manages its energy. This involves intelligently scheduling the demands at the customer side, selling (when there is a surplus) and buying (when there is a deficit) the power from its neighboring microgrids depending on its current and future needs. In this work, we formulate the problems of demand and battery scheduling, energy trading and dynamic pricing (where we allow the microgrids to decide the price of the transaction depending on their current configuration of demand and renewable energy) in the framework of stochastic games. Subsequently, we propose a novel approach that makes use of independent learners Deep Q-learning algorithm to solve this problem.</a></p></details></p>

Any complex application with any kind of input can be modeled using deep neural network architecture. Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled devices to connect with each other and share resources over the Internet. Multimodal input, be it in the form of text, images, video, audio, etc. obtained via sensors on the IoT devices can be processed. Moreover, to reduce computation load, edge computing and cloud-based deployment of applications are being enforced widely. Owing to hardware resource constraints of IoT infrastructure, proper design becomes important to ensure good performance. Security also becomes a key factor when data is shared using the cloud. Therefore, a discussion on current trends, technologies and challenges to be addressed when creating a DL based IoT application is presented below.</a></p></details></p>
